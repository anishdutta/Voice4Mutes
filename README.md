## Overview

Our project was inspired by the current scenario/status of speech and hearing impaired people and how the biggest challenges faced by them are  lack of social interaction, language and communication problems. We plan to reduce this divide. Voice4mutes powers individuals to overcome the barrier of communication using technology.
